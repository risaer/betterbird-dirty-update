# betterbird-dirty-update
Quick and Dirty Install/Update Betterbird on linux (Debian based like Debian, Ubuntu, Mint)

I have only tried it with v. 102 and i cannot garantee for proper functionality.

# I M P O R T A N T
I have written it for myself and for me it works (now). Maybe it does not work for you. Maybe betterbird changes something somewhen.
This is not for beginners. Inspect the code and adapt it to your needs!

*It might be faulty. Use this on your own risk*


# What it does
- Downloads the archive from the betterbird website
- checks the sh256
- extracts it to your desired directory (default is `~/betterbird` )
- creates a .desktop file


## Howto

* clone repo or simple download the script and make it executable.
* open the script and adapt variables
* run it
* if everything went well:
    * betterbird is updated
    * a .desktop file is ~/Betterbird.desktop which can be copied to your desktop (you might need to mark it as trusted)
